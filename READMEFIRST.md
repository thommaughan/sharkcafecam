# Shark Café Cam

### How to navigate this repository
Each folder describes a certain component of the overall project. The subfolders within each of these folders has  a combination of subfolder including a readme.md, mechanical, electrical, and software. First, you should open the "readme.md" which provides necessary information or steps for that component. The Mechanical describes any physical component or mechanism for that component. The electrical describes the components used and how the were wired. The software describes any software that was used to control the electrical components. 

The first two folders to open are the tools list and soldering basics. The tools list describes all necessary tools to work with or create the necessary components of this project. Soldering Basics describes the process of soldering and some tips that may help with completing or ensuring the stability of components. 

### Goal
The goal of this open source guide is to enable people to build their own behavior triggered animal cameras that they can utilize for their own projects and purposes. This open source is built with the mindset that It has enough information to where it can stand alone, yet benefits from further investigation.

### Behavior triggered camera tag
The shark Cafe Cam is a behavior-triggered imaging system that was developed by MBARI engineers to study the behavior of white sharks (*Carcharodon carcharias*) during their stay in the north pacific. This system is intended to be modular, with the ability to be built from different components granted modification extends to the rest of the system. The purpose of these instructions is to allow someone to build a shark-mounted camera themselves. To learn what components are needed and how they’re put together and prepared. This system is intended to be low cost, light weight, retrievable and reusable.

For a long time little was known of white shark migration. They were thought to stay around the California coast. In 2012 Sal Jorgensen and his team tracked a group of white sharks and found out the reality was more mysterious. The image above shows estimated migration routes of white sharks with ech dot representing a location estimate for a given time.The large cluster of dots in the center of the above image shows that white sharks are staying in that area between the coast of California and Hawaii. This puzzled scientists. The area, for its mystery, and yearly congregation of white sharks was named the White Shark Café.

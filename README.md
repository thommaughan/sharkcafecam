Shark Café Cam
---

### Behavior triggered camera tag
The shark Cafe Cam is a behavior-triggered imaging system that was developed by MBARI engineers to study the behavior of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) during their stay in the north pacific. This system is intended to be modular, with the ability to be built from different components granted modification extends to the rest of the system. The purpose of these instructions is to allow someone to build a shark-mounted camera themselves and or to gain the skills necessary to build a camera tag for a different animal. To learn what components are needed and how they’re put together and prepared. This system is intended to be low cost, light weight, retrievable and reusable.

## *In an effort to get straight to programing the board we will offer a condensed version of getting started with the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE). The Arduino IDE is a platform created by Arduino to interface with a variety of microcontrollers.*

### Step 1: Download the Arduino IDE
### Step 2: DOwnloading the required drivers for this board
### Step 3: Making use of example code

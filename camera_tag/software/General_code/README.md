### This sketch (Arduino program) contains tidbits of code for a variety of board uses.  

**Note:** Make sure to either download the necessary libraries (anything that says **#include <libraryname.h>**) or comment them out (add **//** before).  

**Note:** a piece of code needs to be added to the SD card reading lines so that the information syncs or writes. As is, empty files are being written to the SD card and once that number reaches 100 the code will stop working. ALternatively, comment out that portion.
